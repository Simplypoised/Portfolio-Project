<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have 31 years experience as an English/Language Arts instructional coach and teacher. 
  Overall, I spent 35 years tutoring and teaching. Using instructional data, I administered 
  needs assessments and examined an individual's standardized test results, performance assessments, 
  and written and graphical products to assess areas of improvement. Next, I wrote descriptive plans 
  of action with strategies to address the needs. Throughout my career, students, teachers, schools, 
  and school districts benefited from my knowledge and skills. I left the learner with their own 
  means of understanding text and strategies they take with them for life.</p>

<p>As I pivoted in my career to Computers and Information technology, I wanted to continue
  inspiring others to achieve in every endeavor. My education and need for knowledge have not 
  stopped and never will. I received my A+ Certification in Information Technology Support and 
  Computer Repair. I acquired CCNA, certification all while battling breast cancer. I enjoy 
  learning and institute fun ways of doing it for myself and others. I want to survive, so I
  challenge myself at every level. I introduced others to technology and taught them the skills 
  needed to access the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>I am now ready to enjoy my creative side which includes writing but it takes money to totally enjoy what I do. 
   I have a repertoire of pieces of writing I want to finish them and share my talents with others through my website.</p>
